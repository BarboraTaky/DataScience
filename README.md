Codes from Kaggle

Welcome to my GitHub. I am Barbora and these all codes come from my Kaggle platform. I compete with four codes in public Kaggle competitions such as Titanic, House Prices, CIFAR10 and Digit Recognizer(also called MNIST), so you can check my leaderboard place in Kaggle with each of that code. The rest of the codes do not have any competition, so it is only basic code for my training purposes. 

I use Python language and its libraries with Machine Learning and Neural Networks algorithms and try to apply AI for solving different kinds of the problems. Always I use the metric for validation of the accuracy of the solution.

If you have any tip/trick for updating my code, do not hesitate to write me. I will be very happy for any feedback.

Have a nice day,
Barbora
